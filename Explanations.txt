This is SQuid GAME recreation built on the top of Three JS.
This is my first attempt to design a Game.. 


Three JS documentation : https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene

So we download the three.js from github page and put it alongside other JS files.

Step 1: Create Scene..
To actually be able to display anything with three.js, we need three things:
 scene, camera and renderer, so that we can render the scene with camera.
 Initially on doing so, we get black background.
We need Camera to view a scene. We use perspective camera.
